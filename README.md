## Git-ignored Config Files

These files are not included in the repo, but must be present for the application to work.

- `./src/secrets/firebaseConfig.js`: The config data from the console for this Firebase project (e.g. `apiKey`, `authDomain`, etc.). Simply have a `default export` of the config object in question.
